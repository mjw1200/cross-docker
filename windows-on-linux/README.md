# Windows-on-Linux

This is a .NET 7.0 program that runs on Windows, but it will also run within Docker on Linux. To build this, I followed the [tutorial found here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/docker/build-container?tabs=windows)

You can run this locally with `docker run mjwoptimizely/windows-on-linux` (which works on both Linux and Windows, but running a .NET program on Windows isn't super-exciting.)
